📌 Customer Churn Prediction
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom dataset. By analyzing customer demographics, account details, service usage, and billing information, the goal is to identify factors influencing churn and build a machine learning model to predict it.

🎯 Aim

To analyze customer behavior and detect patterns in churn.

To build a predictive model that helps businesses reduce customer attrition.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

📊 Dataset Description

Size: 7,043 rows × 21 columns

Features:

Demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

Account Info: Tenure, Contract, Payment method, Paperless billing

Services: Internet service, Online security, Tech support, Streaming services, Phone service

Charges: Monthly charges, Total charges

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

🚀 Approach

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, removed inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized churn distribution, tenure trends, and service usage.

Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables, processed numerical features.

Modeling: Applied Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluation: Used Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for model assessment.

📈 Results

Achieved 79% accuracy in churn prediction.

Identified tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and payment method as major churn drivers.

Model provided actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
